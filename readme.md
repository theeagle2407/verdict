> Scaffold-Stylus currently does not support Windows natively. If you're using Windows, we recommend:
>
> - **Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** - Install WSL2 and run Scaffold-Stylus within the Linux environment
> - **Switch to Linux or macOS** - For the best development experience
>
> For WSL setup, follow the [Microsoft WSL installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-Stylus, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Stylus tools

First, install Rust and Cargo:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Check the [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more information.

Then install the Stylus CLI tools.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** This project requires `cargo-stylus` version `0.10.8` and `rustc` version `1.91.0` (as pinned in `packages/stylus/contracts/rust-toolchain.toml`). Do NOT use `stylusup` to install Stylus tools, as it installs the latest versions which are incompatible with these pinned requirements.

```bash
cargo install --force --locked cargo-stylus@0.10.8
```

**Prerequisite:**

- `cargo-stylus` version `0.10.8`
- `rustc` version match with `packages/stylus/contracts/rust-toolchain.toml`

Set default `toolchain` match `rust-toolchain.toml` and add the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build target to your Rust compiler:

```bash
rustup default 1.91.0
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.91.0
```

You should now have it available as a Cargo subcommand:

```bash
cargo stylus --help
```

### 2. Create a new project (recommended)

Use the interactive setup to scaffold a new project:

```bash
npx create-stylus@latest
```

Then navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd <project-name>
yarn install
# Initialize submodules (required for Nitro dev node)
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Clone this repo & install dependencies (alternative)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arb-Stylus/scaffold-stylus.git
cd scaffold-stylus
yarn install
# Initialize submodules (required for Nitro dev node)
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 4. Run a local network

In your first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Stylus-compatible network using the Nitro dev node script (`./nitro-devnode/run-dev-node.sh`). The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the Nitro dev node configuration in the `nitro-devnode` submodule.

### 5. Deploy the test contract

In your second terminal:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/stylus/contracts/your-contract/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/stylus/scripts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script .

### 6. Start your NextJS app

In your third terminal:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app at: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the **Debug Contracts** page, which provides a user-friendly interface for testing your contract's functions and viewing its state.

### 7. Test your smart contract

```bash
yarn stylus:test
```

## Development Workflow

- Edit your smart contract `lib.rs` in `packages/stylus/contracts/your-contract/src`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/app`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/stylus/scripts`

## Create Your Own Contract

Scaffold-Stylus enables you to create and deploy multiple contracts within a single project. Follow the steps below to create and deploy your own contracts.

### Step 1: Generate New Contract

Use the following command to create a new contract and customize it as needed:

```bash
yarn new-module <contract-name>
```

The generated contract will be located in `packages/stylus/contracts/<contract-name>`.

**Workspace structure:** `packages/stylus/contracts` is a Cargo workspace with `members = ["*"]`. `yarn new-module <name>` (via `scripts/new_module.sh`) scaffolds the new contract under `contracts/` — the glob auto-discovers it, no manual wiring needed.

### Step 2: Validate Your Contract Before Deployment

Before deploying, it's recommended to validate your contract size using `cargo stylus check`:

```bash
cd packages/stylus/contracts/<contract-name>
cargo stylus check
```

This command performs several important checks:

- **Contract size validation**: Ensures your contract doesn't exceed size limitations
- **WASM compilation**: Verifies your Rust code compiles to WebAssembly
- **Deployment hash computation**: Calculates the deployment hash
- **WASM data fee estimation**: Estimates the cost of deploying your contract

**Contract Size Indicators:**

- 🔴 **Red indicator**: Contract size exceeds limitations - **DO NOT DEPLOY**
- 🟡 **Yellow/🟢 Green indicator**: Contract size within acceptable limits - **OK to deploy**

> **Important:** When using constructors, error logs from constructor execution may not be visible. Consider using `initialize()` functions instead for better error visibility.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Contract

```bash
yarn deploy [...options]
```

This command runs the `deploy.ts` script located in `packages/stylus/scripts`. You can customize this script with your deployment logic.

**Available Options:**

- `--network <network>`: Specify which network to deploy to
- `--estimate-gas`: Only perform gas estimation without deploying
- `--max-fee=<maxFee>`: Set maximum fee per gas in gwei

**Note:** Deployment information is automatically saved in `packages/stylus/deployments` by default.

## Deploying to Other Networks

To deploy your contracts to other networks (other than the default local Nitro dev node), you'll need to configure your RPC endpoint and wallet credentials.

### Prerequisites

1. **Set the RPC URL**

   Configure your target network's RPC endpoint using the proper `RPC_URL_<network>` environment variable. You can set this in your shell or create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for reference):

   ```env
   RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://your-network-rpc-url
   ```

   **Note:** If RPC URL is not provided, system will use default public RPC URL from that network

2. **Set the Private Key**

   For real deployments, you must provide your own wallet's private key. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY_<network>` environment variable:

   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY_SEPOLIA=your_private_key_here
   ```

   **Security Note:** A development key is used by default when running the Nitro dev node locally, but for external deployments, you must provide your own private key.

3. **Set the Account Address**

   Set the `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_<network>`

   ```env
   ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=your_account_address_here
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Configuration**

   Open `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` and update the `targetNetworks` array to include your target chain. This ensures your frontend connects to the correct network and generates the proper ABI in `deployedContracts.ts`:

   ```ts
   import * as chains from "./utils/scaffold-stylus/supportedChains";
   // ...
   targetNetworks: [chains.arbitrumSepolia],
   ```

### Arbitrum Testnet Faucets (Optional)

For Arbitrum testnets, you may need testnet ETH to deploy contracts. You can obtain testnet tokens from these faucets:

- [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/arbitrum-sepolia)
- [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia)
- [Alchemy Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

### Available Networks

This template supports Arbitrum networks only. You can test which networks are available and their RPC URLs:

```bash
yarn info:networks
```

This will show you all supported networks and their corresponding RPC endpoints.

### Deploy to Other Network (Non-Orbit Chains)

Once configured, deploy to your target network:

```bash
yarn deploy --network <network>
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- The values in `.env.example` provide a template for required environment variables
- **Always keep your private key secure and never commit it to version control**
- Consider using environment variable management tools for production deployments
